Due to the top competition and higher cost of medical education in India, the number of Indian students migrates to abroad for pursuing medical education. Medicine is a field that can be studied and explore anywhere in the world.<p>Parents of students always worry about to send their children for studying abroad. The reason behind this is that they are unaware of the lack of safety, learning environment, the security of students in abroad, but Europe is the place that leaves a positive impact on their conscience. Whether in terms of security concerns, quality education, the European countries has been listed on top position.<p>Therefore, nowadays the MBBS in Europe has become the best choice for Indian students. European countries like Russia, Georgia, Poland, Germany etc. are well-known for offering world-class medical education.<p>The exposure to a new culture, low-cost education, state of the art infrastructure and prominent faculty members added the benefit of MBBS in Europe.</p>"
