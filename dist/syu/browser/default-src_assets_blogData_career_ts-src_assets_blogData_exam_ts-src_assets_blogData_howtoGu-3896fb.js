But for the students, it is very difficult to secure an admission to a Government medical college. There is a huge competition as the number of institutions and effectively the number of available seats are very less compared to the number of students appearing.</p><p>To study MBBS in India a student will need to spend more than Rs.75 lakhs but if a student choose to study MBBS abroad, then he/ she will have to spend between Rs.15 lakhs to Rs.50 lakhs only.</p><p>As a result, students prefer private medical colleges. These medical colleges take capitation fees from the students apart from the tuition fees and the tuition fees are also very higher.</p><p>Hence, students prefer to study MBBS abroad. Either students can work hard to get an admission into a Government medical college in India or they can pursue MBBS in abroad in the countries which offer it at low cost.</p><p>But students would need to choose the right country and the right college.</p>'

The Indian ambassador for the concurrent embassy in Georgia keeps attending the ceremonies organized in Georgia to interact with existing Indian students.</p><p>Apart from the main fee structure, the students' expenses are another factor to research before planning to study abroad. In Georgia, the average cost of living goes around 3000$ per annum (250$/ Month Approx.) that mostly consist of Food charges, Rates of Accommodation & Laundry services. <b>This cost is relatively cheaper than what students have to consider in other European countries</b>.</p><p>European Universities, including Georgia, are well aware of the <b>exponential growth in foreign education among Indian students</b>. Hence, taking this consideration to accounts, these universities have altered necessary changes that are more likely suitable for the Indian students. </p><p>Georgian Universities understand the relevance of NMC approval is crucial for Indian aspirants and that their colleges have been granted such <b>recognition from NMC, WHO & other global recognition committees</b>. Plenty of Private Institutes provides NMC coaching for Indian students & maintain above-average passing percentage.</p><p>In order to configure the supremacy of any foreign university, it is recommended to rely on the support system of the management more than the age of the college or university. You can clarify these aspects by analyzing the feedback by the students who are now part of either of these universities or graduated from there. </p><p><a href=https://www.selectyouruniversity.com/neet-exam.php target=_blank>National Entrance Examination Test (NEET)</a> is a mandatory qualification criterion demanded by any university in Georgia for their admission requirement and with a stipulated score. There are plenty of substantial characteristics of the universities that applicants can figure out to select the university of their choice.</p>"

Schooling not only guides but also trains the mind for the long road onwards of getting into a job, forming a family, and becoming a responsible resident. While primary and secondary studies prepare the mind for the journey forth, higher education feeds you with the needed skill set to thrive in a career of your choice.</p><p>The Indian constitution assigned the duty of dissemination of education to the state government in the year 1950. Universities were set up in particular states to assure higher education was made obtainable to students from the state. Later, via amendment in 1976, this responsibility was split between the state governments and the central government.</p><p>Universities were established across the nation to ensure people had the keys to higher schooling. The administration for identifying universities in India is the University Grants Commission (UGC), which was awarded this power through the University Grants Commission Act of 1956. </p><p>Now we are going to take a look at what state universities exactly are and see a list of all the state universities across India, the advantages they offer to the students, and further related matters.</p>"

                "data": "<p>State universities are surely a good bet for students. In India, in fact, parents often look forward to bringing their infant into state universities although a deemed or private university with adequate allowance may be just a block away from their residences. The causes for this type of preference are manifold.</p><p>The first and most significant cause is that they are ‘state universities’. This to many is an automatic confirmation of many things. A state university will never be lacking of allowances because the stand is on the state to deliver for their maintenance and supervision. That is a considerable benefit for many: no one likes to take the risk of placing their child in a university where there is no assurance of continuity.Secondly, there is the question of prestige. Some of the oldest organizations of higher studies in India, like the University of Mumbai, the University of Calcutta, and the University of Madras are state universities.</p><p>The third reason is of course understanding. Many families have family members, relatives, or acquaintances that examined and passed out of a state university. That provides the university with an atmosphere of positivity and an automatic dose of goodwill. For many, it is a case of continuity and a necessity for the student to experience the university they went to.</p><p>With this, we reach to an end to our blog on the List of State Universities in India. We hope this blog fed you with all the details you required about the state universities in India.</p>"

In India, private universities are operated under the UGC (Establishment and Maintenance of Standards in Private Universities) 2003 Regulations.

Also, per the 2003 regulations, the UGC sends councils to examine private universities and issues their inspection report.</p><p>The UGC issues and regularly revise the lists of private universities. The latest UGC consolidated list of universities lists <b>410 private universities.</b> Private universities were set up in 24 states out of the 28 states of India and in none of the 8 UTs (union territories).</p><p>Section 12 (B) of the UGC Act of 1956 also gives the UGC the liberty to "allocate and disburse, out of the Fund of the Commission, grants to Universities" As such, the UGC may announce a private university as "Included under 12(B) of the UGC Act, 1956". Updates to these orders are done in conferences of the UGC and issued in the minutes. </p><p>The most recent list, issued by the UGC on 8 October 2021, records 15 private universities as enclosed under 12(B).</p><p>In simple words, Private universities are approved by UGC. However, such academies do not run on central or state accounts. They can award diplomas/degrees but cannot have off-campus colleges or affiliate with a college/institution. They can set up the off-campus center (s) within the concerned state after their existence of 5 years and with the earlier consent of the UGC, declares the UGC website. Unlike state and central universities which have a ‘Chancellor’ as the authority, a private university is always ruled by a ‘President’ or ‘Chairperson’.</p><p>Private universities need to follow UGC rules and regulations for functions. The UGC regularly sends panels to review Private universities.</p>'

Yet, the main question from a student’s point of view: is pursuing study in a deemed university a good picture?</p><p>Contrary to famous opinion, deemed universities are very promising educational choices for students. They have, in many concerns, the potential to be even finer than the multiple state universities in each state.</p><p>Many of these deemed universities have amazing course-ware for their students. This is achievable because of the liberation they enjoy in creating programs assuming changes in science, technology, and changing needs for skill in the employment market.</p><p> A number of these deemed universities likewise come with hi-tech study facilities which provide aspiring students to continue to pursue specialization options in niche regions.</p><p>Of course, there is an opposite side to all this as well. There are some deemed universities that may take benefit from the freedom offered where the policies and procedures set by these universities may not be holding the adequate interests of the students.</p><p>There has been plenty of buzz in the media in recent times about this, and the outcome has affected all of the universities being looked at negatively.  It is important for you to perform analysis and desire guidance while deciding to select from deemed universities.</p><p>A Few of the key concerns you need to pay attention to while picking deemed universities for higher studies are – history, founders, if the syllabus offered is recent and future proof, industry affiliations, infrastructure available, etc.</p>"

As the students are capable to transmit credits between central universities, further options are becoming available, and students are open to more additional course choices.</p><p>For example, with the old system, a sociology student was not able to take a physics lesson. It should be stated that many of the Central Universities are somewhat young.
